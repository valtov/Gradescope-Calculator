Make it so adding a categroy allows the user to name the category
- Change N+ button to be a form submit field

Dont allow words, or negative numbers in percentage field

Make it so whatever the user selected as a category sticks around upon refreshes. 
- If a user deletes a category, and that one was set before, set a default category

Make it so a user can change the grade distribution (left hand side of popup window). Make it so the cutoffs the user provides make sense. Dont allow A to be 90 and A- to be 91 for example

If possible, make it so instead of saving entire html for the popup table, it rebuilds the table based upon a smaller amount of information it saves

Calculate overall grade based on the grade distribution (left hand side of popup window) and based upon the percentage weights of each corresponding category.

Allow user to add a new temporary assignment to test. Like adding a 3rd homework when they only have 2.
